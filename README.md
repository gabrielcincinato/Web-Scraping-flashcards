# Flashcards Web Scraping

A simple flashcard webscraping. It will collect words from every page in [Dicio's most searched words](https://www.dicio.com.br/palavras-mais-buscadas/1/), their meanings and store in a CSV file so you can transform it into flashcards using the Anki software and train your portuguese.
